Problem Statement

Interns are expected to create a TensorFlow model for the identification of color. Your code will be given an image as an input, and the code is supposed to categorize which RGB color it matches. This code is to be done in Python.

Solution

For the implementation of this project, I have created the dataset using numpy and RGB color codes. The train and test dataset images are available in the zip file. One can use any image from the test folder to implement in the code.
